            Gheorghe "Gică" Hagi is a Romanian former professional footballer, considered one of the best players in the world during the 1980s and '90s
            and the greatest Romanian footballer of all time.Galatasaray fans called him "Comandante" ("The Commander") and Romanians call him "Regele" ("The King").
            He is currently the owner and manager of Viitorul Constanța.
          </p>
          <div class="parag-1">
            <h4>Club career</h4>
            <p>Born in Săcele, Hagi started his career playing for the youth teams of Farul Constanța in the 1970s, before being selected by the Romanian Football
              Federation to join the squad of Luceafărul București in 1980 for two years. In 1982, he returned to Constanța, but one year later, aged 18, he was prepared
              to make the step to a top team. He was originally directed to Universitatea Craiova, but chose Sportul Studențesc of Bucharest instead.</p>
            <p>In late 1987, Hagi transferred to Steaua București as the team prepared for their European Super Cup final against Dynamo Kyiv. The original contract was for one game only, the final. However, after winning the trophy, where Hagi
              scored the only goal of the match, Steaua did not want to release him back to Sportul Studențesc and retained him. During his Steaua years (1987–1990), Hagi played 97 Liga I games, scoring 76 goals. He and the team reached the European
              Cup semi-final in 1988 and the final in the following year, while Hagi finished as one of the competition's top scorers in the former edition of the tournament. Hagi and Steaua were the champions of Romania in 1987, 1988 and 1989 and as
              well as winning the Cupa României in 1987, 1988 and 1989. His strong performances had him linked with Arrigo Sacchi's Milan and Bayern Munich, but Nicolae Ceaușescu's communist government rejected any offer.</p>

          <div clas s="parag-2">
            <h4>International career</h4>
            <p>Hagi made his debut for the Romania national team at age 18 in 1983 against Norway, in Oslo. He was part of the Romanian team until 2000.</p>
            <p>Hagi took part at the 1990 World Cup and later led the Romanian team to its best ever international performance at the 1994 World Cup, where the team reached the quarterfinals before Sweden ended their run after winning the penalty
              shoot-out. Hagi scored three times in the tournament, including a memorable goal in their 3–2 surprise defeat of South American powerhouse and previous runners-up Argentina. In the first of Romania's group stage matches, against
              Colombia, Hagi scored one of the most memorable goals of that tournament, curling in a 40-yard lob over Colombian goalkeeper Óscar Córdoba who was caught out of position. He was named in the Team of the Tournament.</p>
            <p>Four years later, after the 1998 World Cup, Hagi decided to retire from the national team, only to change his mind after a few months and participate in UEFA Euro 2000, during which he was sent off in the quarter-final loss against
              eventual runners-up Italy.
              Hagi retired from professional football in 2001, age 36, in a game called "Gala Hagi" on 24 April. He still holds the record as Romanian national team top scorer.</p>

          <div class="parag-3">
            <h4>Style of play</h4>
            <p>A talented left-footed attacking midfielder, Hagi's playing style was frequently compared with Diego Maradona's throughout his career, due to his technical ability as well as his temperamental character and leadership.As a youth, he
              was mainly inspired by compatriots Anghel Iordănescu and Ion Dumitru.</p>
            <p>A quick, highly creative, and mobile advanced playmaker, Hagi was also tactically versatile, and capable of playing in several midfield and offensive positions on either wing or through the middle, due to his ability with both feet,
              despite being naturally left-footed, although he had a preference for using his stronger foot.His preferred position was in a free role as a classic number 10, but he was also used as a second striker on occasion.</p>

            <h3>Romania national team</h3>
            <p>In 2001, Hagi was named the manager of the Romania national team, replacing Ladislau Bölöni, who left the squad to coach Sporting Clube de Portugal. After failing to qualify the team for the World Cup, however, Hagi was sacked. His
              only notable achievement during the six months as Romania's manager was the win in Budapest against Hungary.</p>

            <h3>Galatasaray</h3>
            <p>Hagi then became manager of Galatasaray in 2004, leading the team to the Turkish Cup in 2005 final with 5–1 as a score against fierce rivals Fenerbahçe. His contract, however, was not renewed since his team was not able to win 2004–05
              Süper Lig title over Fenerbahçe during the centennial of the club.</p></a>

            <h3>Steaua Bucuresti</h3>
            <p>From June to September 2007, Hagi coached Steaua București, had a mediocre start in the internal championship mainly due to the large number of unavailable injured players, and managed to qualify the team for the second time in line to
              the UEFA Champions League group stages, passing two qualifying rounds. He resigned due to a long series of conflicts with club owner Gigi Becali, which also happens to be his godson.</p></a>

            <p>In September 2014, Hagi appointed himself manager of Viitorul Constanța, in addition to being the owner and charmain of the club. Successfully avoiding relegation in his first season, Viitorul went on to be the season's wonder in the
              2015–16 season, finishing the first half of the regular season on 3rd place, which led Hagi to being named Romania Coach of the Year.</p>
